# foldhue.nvim
Add some color to your dreary neovim foldtext! Mostly a proof of concept, but it works enough for me for daily use!

Install with your favorite plugin manager, then enable it in your configuration with `require('foldhue').enable()`

See `:h foldhue` for basic notes on customization.

## Caveats

While editing the file, the fold colors can be janky. I would love a PR if you can find the errors, but I will not be focusing on fixing them.
